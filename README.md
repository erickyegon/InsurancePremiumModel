## Overview

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning solution for predicting health insurance premiums based on customer attributes and health indicators. It demonstrates a comprehensive approach to the machine learning lifecycle, from data preprocessing and model development to production deployment with MLOps best practices.

## Problem Statement

Health insurance companies face significant challenges in accurately pricing premiums that balance profitability with competitive rates. Traditional actuarial methods often struggle to capture the complex relationships between customer attributes, health indicators, and appropriate premium levels.

This project addresses several key challenges:

1. **Risk Assessment Complexity**: Health insurance risk assessment involves numerous interdependent variables (age, medical history, lifestyle factors) with non-linear relationships to claim likelihood and cost.

2. **Data Heterogeneity**: Insurance data combines categorical variables (gender, region), numerical features (age, income), and ordinal data (BMI categories) requiring sophisticated preprocessing.

3. **Model Interpretability**: Insurance pricing models must balance predictive accuracy with interpretability for regulatory compliance and customer transparency.

4. **Model Drift**: Health trends, medical costs, and demographic patterns evolve over time, necessitating robust monitoring and retraining protocols.

5. **Scalable Deployment**: Insurance companies need solutions that can handle varying loads during enrollment periods while maintaining consistent performance.

Our solution leverages machine learning to create a more accurate, data-driven approach to premium prediction while implementing a production-grade system with comprehensive monitoring and maintenance capabilities.

This project focuses on developing, evaluating, and deploying a machine learning model to predict health insurance premiums. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset containing demographic, medical, and lifestyle information, the model aims to provide personalized premium estimations for improved risk assessment and fairer pricing in the insurance industry.

This repository contains the code, documentation, and resources necessary to understand, replicate, and potentially extend this end-to-end machine learning solution.

## Problem Statement

Accurately estimating health insurance premiums is a critical challenge for insurance providers. Traditional methods often rely on broad categorizations that may not reflect individual risk accurately. This can lead to either underpricing (resulting in financial losses for the insurer) or overpricing (leading to customer dissatisfaction and potential loss of business). This project addresses this by developing a machine learning model capable of predicting premiums based on individual characteristics, and by demonstrating how this model can be deployed for practical use.

---

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover insights into factors influencing insurance premiums.
2. Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure high-quality input for modeling.
3. Engineer meaningful features that improve model performance.
4. Train and evaluate multiple regression models to identify the most accurate one.
5. Deploy the final model as a scalable web service using FastAPI.
6. Provide thorough documentation for reproducibility and extension.
